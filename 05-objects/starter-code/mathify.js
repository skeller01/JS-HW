/**
 * You've heard of the JavaScript Math library. Well, who needs that when you have Mathify!
 * Mathify is an object that contains numbers and simple arithmatic functions so you don't need to use
 * pesky operators.
 *
 * Create a Mathify object with keys 'one' through 'ten' that have values of their respective numbers.
 * Mathify should also have functions for add, subtract, divide and multiply. Each function should take
 * two parameters and return the result of the operation.
