## Advanced API Concepts

--

### Authentication

- API Keys (simple)
- OAuth (complex)

--

#### OAuth

An open authentication standard that allows you to authenticate your application on behalf of a user.

--

#### OAuth

--

#### OAuth

The OAuth flow is complicated and implemented differently by different services.

--

### Custom Client Libraries / SDKs

Note:

Thankfully, most services that employ OAuth type authentication will also provide a library that can be used to execute OAuth requests. Generally, these libraries will be offered in many different languages, JS being one of them.
