## What to look at next?

--

### Front-End Frameworks

--

#### Front-End Frameworks

Goals:
- Obvious: Help to organize large applications
- Non-obvious: Reduce the cognitive strain of starting new projects

--

#### Front-End Frameworks

- React
- Angular

--

### Advanced Node

--

#### Node for creating servers

Use Node to create "endpoints" that your front-end applications can interact with

--

#### Express

The dominant framework for creating node servers.

--

#### MongoDB

A "noSQL" (document) database that is used in many node/express applications.

--

#### MEAN Stack

- MongoDB (Database)
- Express (Back-end Framework)
- Angular (Front-end Framework)
- Node

--

### NPM For Front-End Applications

--

#### NPM

Just like NPM can be used for node back-end dependencies, it can be used for front-end dependencies as well.

--

#### Packaging Big Front-End Applications

When our applications start getting big, we need to split them into separate files.

--

#### Packaging Tools

- bower
- webpack

--

### ES6

--

#### ES6

ES6 introduces some new syntax that is starting to make its way into tutorials, etc

--

#### ES6 let and const

```js
var myVariable = 0;
let anotherVariable = 1;
const yetAnotherVariable = 2;
```

--

#### ES6 Arrow Functions

```js
var myES5Function = function(hello) {
  console.log(hello);
};
var myES6ArrowFunction = (hello) => {
  console.log(hello);
};
```

--

### bind, call, apply

These methods are used to alter `this` among other things.

--

### Testing JavaScript

--

#### Testing JavaScript

We can create "test suites" to verify that changes to our code don't change the assumed behavior.

--

#### Testing Frameworks

- Mocha
- Jasmine

---

## Jacob's (unscientific) tips for job searching

--

### Exude Passion

--

--

### Demonstrated interest (outside of the day-to-day)

--

### Admit what you don't know

---

## Don't be afraid to be green

--
