// Relying on your newfound knowledge of loops, combine loops and if/else statements together and incrementally build the common fizzbuzz loop.

// - In the loop, every time a number is divisible by **3**, instead of logging the number itself, the word "fizz" should appear.
// - If the number is divisible by  **5**, the word "buzz" should be logged.
// - If the number is divisible by both **3** and  **5**, then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.

// Follow the steps below.

// ##### Step 1:
// Construct a for loop that iterates through, and `console.log()`'s out, numbers 1 - 100.



// ##### Step 2:
// Add an `if/else` statement that logs the string `"fizz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by `3`; otherwise, log out the value.
// Hint: Remember the "modulus" operator.


// ##### Step 3:
// Add an `else if` clause that logs the string `"buzz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by `5`.



// ##### Step 4:
// Add an additional clause that logs the string `"fizzbuzz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by both `3` and `5`.
// Hint: You may have to change the order.



// ##### Step 5:
// Convert your for loop to a while loop.
