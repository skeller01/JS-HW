# Assignment 2

* **99 Bottles of Beer** (bottles.js)
  - Write a script that logs to the console the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with the song, you can [find the lyrics here](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html).
  - Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "100 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer").
* **Random Address Generator** (address.js)
  - Write a script that can generate random addresses
  - As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name and zip code
  - Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
  - Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
  - `node random-address.js`
  - `=> 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506`
* **BONUS: What day?** (day.js)
  - Write a `switch` statement to log to the console the appropriate day name for a given number.
    - 0: Sunday
    - 1: Monday
    - 2: Tuesday
    - 3: Wednesday
    - 4: Thursday
    - 5: Friday
    - 6: Saturday
  - Write a second `switch` statement to log 'Weekday' or 'Weekend' based on a given number. Use fall-through.
