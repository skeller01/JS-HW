// Random Address Generator (address.js)
// Write a script that can generate random addresses
// As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name and zip code
// Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
// Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
// node random-address.js
// => 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506
// BONUS: What day? (day.js)
// Write a switch statement to log to the console the appropriate day name for a given number.
// 0: Sunday
// 1: Monday
// 2: Tuesday
// 3: Wednesday
// 4: Thursday
// 5: Friday
// 6: Saturday
// Write a second switch statement to log 'Weekday' or 'Weekend' based on a given number. Use fall-through.
